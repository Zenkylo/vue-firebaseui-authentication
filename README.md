# Vue FirebaseUI Authentication Boilerplate
This is a sample Vue.js project exercising the FirebaseUI authentication flow.
This project was initialized with Vue CLI.
You will need a Google Cloud Platform account, project, and app to apply your app's 
configuration to the project. All information on how to set up the auth flow was found on the following two pages. 
Refer to the `FirebaseAuthentication.vue` file for a closer look at implementation. This is to be used as a guide.
